This directory contains the files you need to run an example implementation demonstrating how to use FootNet. Before you start, FootNet was developed using Python 3.6.9 so make sure you can access that version or above for this example. There is a requirements.txt file indicating the dependencies you will need to run the example properly that you can use to create a virtual environment. 

FootNet is saved in SavedModel format (directory), which is the new Tensorflow native format. If you have not already downloaded it from the main directory of this repository, ou can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=18y8RhQTH3d1Nqp-CWiM415suUZxqjj-9). You can then download the data to run the example and the Python script from within this directory. **The Python script was made flexible to be able to find the data without the user having to specify the filepath. For this, just make sure your Data_example.mat file and FootNet_implementation.py file are in the same directory.**
