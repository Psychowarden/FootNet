Most of my PhD data processing scripts were written in Matlab (using Windows OS) so I had to find a workaround to integrate FootNet. This can be achieved by using [FootNet_call_CMD.bat](./FootNet_call_CMD.bat). This batch file executes FootNet_infernece.py through the command prompt, and can be called through Matlab.
